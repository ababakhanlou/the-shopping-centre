A functional based React application using TypeScript and making use of Hooks that is replicating an e-commerce website. 
It has functionality to add items to a basket, search items and a review basket page. 
In the review basket page, all the items added to basket are displayed and allows for basket modifications. 
It uses Redux to manage state, filter the category of items from the screen, the items within the basket and the current total checkout price of the basket.
